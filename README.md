## History
zKillboard began as the brainchild of Squizz Caphinator, who wanted to improve upon the [Eve-Dev Killboard](https://github.com/evekb/evedev-kb). Rather than continue modifying existing code, Squizz chose to start fresh and wrote a new killboard from scratch.

Karbowiak of eve-kill.net joined the project, contributed a significant amount of code, [created a repository on GitHub](https://github.com/EVE-KILL/zKillboard), and announced zKillboard as the new beta killboard for eve-kill.net.

zKillboard matured, gained a loyal user base—and, inevitably, some haters. Eventually, creative differences between Squizz and Karbowiak led to Squizz forking the project and making this repository the official home of zKillboard.com.

In the following year, Squizz began exploring NoSQL databases, which better suited the scale and structure of killmail data. After two months of intense development and major database changes, the repository was made public with full NoSQL support.

With the shutdown of eve-kill.net and Battleclinic in the years leading up to 2015, Squizz committed to ensuring all collected killmails remained accessible to the public. Various APIs and killmail data dumps are available—see the Wiki for details.
