# Streambox

Streambox is a simple, lightweight tool built for streamers who want to showcase their most recent killmails live on stream.

## How It Works

Viewing your Streambox is easy:

1. Go to your character, corporation, or alliance page on [zKillboard.com](https://zkillboard.com).
2. Add `streambox` to the end of the URL.

For example, if your character page is:

    https://zkillboard.com/character/1633218082/

Adding `streambox` gives you:

    https://zkillboard.com/character/1633218082/streambox/

If you have recent killmails, Streambox will display them in a clean, stream-friendly layout.  
If you don’t, it’ll just stay empty until you get back to work making explosions.

Want only solo kills? Just navigate to your solo page and tack on `/streambox/`:

    https://zkillboard.com/character/1633218082/solo/streambox/

## Why Streambox?

Streambox was originally requested by streamer **Brother Grimoire**, a well-known pirate enthusiast. Frustrated by other streamer tools breaking or losing support, he wanted something reliable, simple, and built directly into zKillboard. That’s exactly what Streambox delivers.
